🛠️ FourServoController
📌 Project Overview
FourServoController is a simple Arduino-based project designed to control four servo motors simultaneously. Each servo motor moves from 0° to 180° and back in a synchronized sweeping motion, demonstrating how to use the Servo library efficiently.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to servo control and can be used as a foundation for more advanced robotics or automation systems.

⚙️ Components Used
Arduino Uno

4 × Servo motors (e.g., SG90)

Jumper wires

Breadboard (optional)

Power supply (USB or external)

💡 Features
Controls four servos in sync

Smooth sweeping motion

Clean, easy-to-understand code

Works with Tinkercad or physical Arduino setups

Great for robotics learning and prototyping

🔄 How It Works
All four servos move together in a loop, sweeping from 0° to 180°, then back to 0°. This mimics a coordinated motion like that used in robotic arms or mechanical systems.

🚀 Future Ideas
Add buttons or sensors for user input

Control each servo individually

Integrate with a robotic arm or smart system

Display servo angles on an LCD or OLED
